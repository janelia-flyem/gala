before_install:
  # Current TravisCI VM is Ubuntu 12.04 which has Python 2.7 and 3.2.
  # So apt-get will only apply to those virtualenvs.
  - sudo apt-get install -qq python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pydot python-gdal
  - sudo apt-get install -qq libhdf5-serial-dev

  # Additionally, the TravisCI VM has numpy preinstalled on 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.
  # So for 3.3 and pypy, numpy is not preinstalled and must be pip-installed.
  # Matplotlib, pydot, and gdal are not available for 3.2 via apt-get.
  # And they are also not available for 2.6, 3.3, and pypy except via pip.
  # We could install via pip, but...
  #   skipping numpy (for 3.3 and pypy) since it takes too long.
  #   skipping scipy (for 2.6, 3.3, and pypy) since it takes too long.
  #   skipping matplotlib (for 2.6, 3.3, and pypy) since it takes too long.
  #   skipping pydot (for all) since it is not 3.x compatible.
  #   skipping gdal (for all) since it has errors while installing from pip.
